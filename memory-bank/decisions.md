## Active Decisions

### Decision #001 ‚Äì SQLite as Primary Database

- **Date**: 2025-01-15
- **Author**: System Architect
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Active
- **Summary**: Use SQLite as the default database with PostgreSQL migration path

**Context**:
- Need simple deployment for single-instance trading engine
- Want easy setup without external database dependencies
- Must support future scaling to PostgreSQL

**Decision**:
- Use SQLite for development and single-server deployment
- Design schema to be PostgreSQL-compatible
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM for database abstraction

**Rationale**:
1. **Simplicity**: Zero configuration, single file database
2. **Portability**: Easy to backup, copy, and restore
3. **Sufficient Performance**: Handles 500 instruments, 50+ trades easily
4. **Migration Ready**: SQLAlchemy makes PostgreSQL migration seamless

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **PostgreSQL Only**: Rejected - overkill for single instance, complex setup
2. **MongoDB**: Rejected - unnecessary for structured trading data
3. **CSV Files**: Rejected - no ACID guarantees, race conditions

**Affected Modules**:
- `src/storage/db.py` - Database connection and operations
- `src/storage/schema.sql` - Schema definition
- All modules that query database

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Benefits:
  - Fast setup and deployment
  - No external dependencies
  - Easy backups (single file)
  - Sufficient for 95% of use cases
  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks:
  - Limited concurrency (not an issue for single process)
  - Size limit ~140 TB (not a concern for this use case)
  - No built-in replication

**Reversal Conditions**:
- If running multiple scanner instances concurrently
- If database size exceeds 10 GB
- If need distributed deployment
- If require advanced PostgreSQL features (JSON queries, etc.)

**References**:
- SQLAlchemy documentation
- SQLite vs PostgreSQL comparison

### Decision #002 ‚Äì Risk-Based Position Sizing

- **Date**: 2025-01-15
- **Author**: Risk Manager
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Active
- **Summary**: All positions sized based on 1.5% risk, not capital allocation

**Context**:
- Traditional approach: Allocate fixed capital per trade (e.g., ‚Çπ50,000)
- Problem: Different stocks have different stop distances
- Result: Inconsistent risk across trades

**Decision**:
- Size every position based on 1.5% risk of total capital
- Formula: `qty = (capital √ó risk%) / (entry - stop)`
- Independent of stock price or stop distance

**Rationale**:
1. **Consistent Risk**: Every trade risks exactly 1.5% of capital
2. **Predictable Losses**: Maximum loss per trade is known in advance
3. **Portfolio Protection**: No single trade can devastate portfolio
4. **Psychological Benefits**: Same risk across all trades reduces emotion

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Fixed Capital Allocation**: Rejected - inconsistent risk
2. **Equal Position Sizes**: Rejected - same issue as fixed capital
3. **Volatility-Based Sizing**: Rejected - overly complex, hard to backtest

**Affected Modules**:
- `src/core/risk.py` - Position sizing calculations
- `src/exec/scanner.py` - Uses risk sizing for entries
- `src/exec/tracker.py` - Tracks risk per position

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Benefits:
  - Consistent risk across all trades
  - Predictable maximum loss
  - Scalable to any capital size
  - Works for any stock price
  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks:
  - Wide stops ‚Üí smaller position sizes
  - Tight stops ‚Üí larger position sizes
  - Capital deployment varies

**Reversal Conditions**:
- If risk-adjusted returns underperform fixed allocation
- If psychological preference for equal position sizes
- If regulatory limits on position sizes

### Decision #003 ‚Äì Hourly Tracking Frequency

- **Date**: 2025-01-16
- **Author**: System Designer
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Active
- **Summary**: Track open positions every hour (09:00-15:00 IST), not continuously

**Context**:
- Need to manage open positions in real-time
- Options: Every minute, every 5 minutes, hourly, daily
- Balance between responsiveness and API efficiency

**Decision**:
- Track positions every hour during market hours
- 7 tracking cycles per day (09:00, 10:00, ..., 15:00)

**Rationale**:
1. **Sufficient Responsiveness**: Hourly checks catch most profit/loss levels
2. **API Efficiency**: 7 calls/day vs 390 calls (per minute)
3. **Reduced Noise**: Hourly timeframe filters market noise
4. **System Stability**: Lower load, fewer errors

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Every Minute**: Rejected - too frequent, expensive, noisy
2. **Every 5 Minutes**: Rejected - still too frequent for strategy
3. **Twice Daily**: Rejected - insufficient responsiveness
4. **Real-Time Tick**: Rejected - overkill for swing trading strategy

**Affected Modules**:
- `src/core/scheduler.py` - Job scheduling
- `src/exec/tracker.py` - Position tracking logic

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Benefits:
  - Low API call volume
  - Stable system performance
  - Adequate for 3WI strategy (swing trades)
  - Reduces false signals from noise
  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks:
  - Delayed reaction to price moves (up to 1 hour)
  - Might miss intra-hour stop losses
  - Trailing stops update hourly, not continuously

**Reversal Conditions**:
- If strategy changes to intraday (scalping/day trading)
- If need tighter risk control (immediate stop loss execution)
- If API costs become negligible

- **Summary**: Limit total open risk to 6% of capital (approximately 4 positions)

**Context**:
- Each position risks 1.5% of capital
- Need to prevent overexposure to market
- Balance between diversification and concentration

**Decision**:
- Maximum total open risk: 6% of capital
- Translates to ~4 concurrent positions at 1.5% each
- Hard limit enforced by scanner before entry

**Rationale**:
1. **Controlled Maximum Loss**: Even if all positions stopped out simultaneously, lose only 6%
2. **Reasonable Diversification**: 4 positions provide some diversification
3. **Manageable Tracking**: 4 positions easy to monitor
4. **Recovery Potential**: 6% loss recoverable with 2-3 good trades

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **10% Limit (6-7 positions)**: Rejected - too many positions, hard to track
